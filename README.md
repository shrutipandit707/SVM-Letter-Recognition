# SVM Letter Recognition
> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Exploratory Data Science techniques. We will be understanding and solving a risk analytics problem in Banking and Financial Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like defaulters prediction in Loan Lending club
